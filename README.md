Palliative care for patients with terminal cancer
=================================
A data-only living systematic review

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is* effective. The [standardized mean difference](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_12/12_6_2_re_expressing_smds_using_rules_of_thumb_for_effect_sizes.htm) is 'small to moderate'.

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that updates a previously published meta-analysis.(1) Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references. 

This repository is a limited review and contains outcomes data only without PICO and Risk of Bias Tables.  This review does not include a GRADE Profile or Summary of Findings Table.

See [methods](http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/methods.html) for details.

**Results:** Details of the studies included are in the:
* [Forest plots](../../tree/master/forest-plots) ([source data](../../tree/master/data))

The forest plot for the primary outcome is below. Additional [forest plots](../../tree/master/forest-plots) of secondary analyses may be available.
